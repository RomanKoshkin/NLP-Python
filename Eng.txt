allow
me
at
the
outset
mr
president
to
congratulate
guatemala
on
assuming
the
presidency
of
the
security
council
this
month
and
to
commend
you
for
organizing
such
an
important
debate
we
participate
in
it
convinced
that
justice
peace
and
security
are
global
public
goods
that
deserve
enhancement
and
protection
their
nature
is
complimentary
not
contradictory
and
the
final
purpose
is
protect
the
integrity
and
dignity
of
people
and
to
provide
reparations
to
victims
former
secretary
general
kofi
anan
says
it
well
in
his
recent
memoir
interventions
alive
in
war
and
peace
the
choice
between
justice
and
peace
is
no
longer
an
option
we
must
be
ambitious
enough
to
pursue
both
and
wise
enough
recognize
respect
and
protect
the
independence
of
justice
in
order
to
fully
exercise
its
mandate
of
maintaining
international
peace
and
security
the
security
council
has
the
duty
to
promote
full
exercise
of
international
justice
and
the
rule
of
law
that
obligation
is
particularly
important
in
relation
to
the
international
criminal
court
although
the
court
is
an
independent
treaty-based
tribunal
the
statute
of
rome
gives
the
council
two
prerogatives
in
its
workings
to
refer
or
defer
cases
from
their
advice
the
right
of
the
council
to
influence
the
courts
actions
and
the
possibility
for
the
court
to
expand
its
jurisdictional
scope
the
nature
of
the
council
is
political
that
of
the
court
is
judicial
therefore
their
relation
will
always
be
complex
for
the
same
reason
the
cooperation
of
the
council
with
the
court
should
be
responsible
and
guided
by
a
set
of
impartial
and
general
principles
that
scrupulously
respect
the
courts
independence
the
council
should
abide
by
the
principle
that
international
criminal
justice
is
not
a
license
for
political
negotiations
or
a
means
to
appease
desperate
but
a
tool
for
fulfilling
essential
duty
to
humanity
and
to
foster
a
more
peaceful
and
safer
international
order
based
on
general
rules
from
that
perspective
costa
rica
wishes
to
suggest
some
guidelines
to
the
security
council
regarding
its
referrals
to
the
court
first
the
council
should
establish
a
protocol
to
refer
to
the
court
any
case
in
which
there
are
strong
indications
of
the
perpetration
of
crimes
defined
by
the
rome
statute
provided
there
is
no
action
in
the
respective
national
jurisdiction
that
is
precisely
what
is
happening
in
syria
but
the
council's
reaction
has
been
paralysis
it
is
time
for
this
situation
to
be
referred
to
international
criminal
court
secondly
the
council
should
make
a
commitment
to
providing
follow
up
and
support
including
financial
support
to
its
referrals
to
the
court
in
the
two
situations
referred
to
the
court
so
far
darfur
and
libya
follow-up
and
further
cooperation
have
been
almost
non-existent
thirdly
it
should
establish
in
its
referrals
the
obligation
of
compliance
by
all
states
including
arrest
warrants
fourthly
it
should
establish
subsidy
bodies
to
systematically
ensure
cooperation
and
followup
fifthly
it
should
harmonize
and
coordinate
its
sanctions
regimes
so
that
they
support
the
orders
and
decisions
of
the
court
sixthly
and
finally
it
should
strengthen
the
mandates
of
peacekeeping
and
peacebuilding
missions
so
as
to
ensure
their
corporation
the
investigations
and
actions
of
the
court
in
short
the
council
should
apply
clear
political
will
in
the
interest
of
justice
establishing
standards
for
action
acting
in
accordance
with
them
and
rejecting
impunity
thus
the
triad
of
peace
security
and
justice
will
be
promoted
seamlessly
and
with
consistency
for
the
benefits
of
the
rule
of
law
members
of
the
council
that
are
signatories
to
the
rome
statute
should
take
the
lead
in
this
respect
we
congratulate
guatemala
on
its
recent
ratification
of
the
instrument
and
for
its
commitment
to
advancing
it
we
thank
the
presidency
of
guatemala
for
convening
today's
meeting
chile
attaches
great
importance
to
the
debate
on
peace
justice
the
special
focus
on
the
role
of
the
international
criminal
court
under
the
agenda
item
the
promotion
and
strengthening
of
the
rule
of
law
in
the
maintenance
of
international
peace
and
security
we
believe
that
without
justice
there
is
no
peace
peace
cannot
exist
without
justice
and
justice
must
be
exercised
with
the
objective
of
ensuring
peace
chile
therefore
considers
that
this
debate
is
extremely
important
as
we're
convinced
that
the
relationship
between
the
international
criminal
court
and
the
united
nations
through
the
general
assembly
and
the
security
council
promotes
the
rule
of
law
encourages
respect
for
human
rights
and
contributes
towards
attaining
international
peace
and
security
in
accordance
with
international
law
and
the
purposes
and
principles
of
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
chile
considers
the
international
criminal
court
to
be
the
most
advanced
expression
of
the
development
of
international
criminal
justice
and
that
it
represents
one
the
most
important
initiatives
of
recent
times
from
the
perspective
of
protecting
human
rights
the
creation
of
the
court
was
an
important
step
in
the
fight
against
impunity
and
a
clear
sign
that
states
parties
that
are
committed
to
the
international
community
in
making
progress
in
that
direction
for
that
reason
our
country
strongly
supports
the
work
of
the
international
criminal
court
and
takes
this
opportunity
to
highlight
the
tenth
anniversary
of
the
entry
into
force
of
the
rome
statute
we
also
welcome
the
court’s
first
judgment
this
year
which
demonstrates
its
proper
functioning
the
main
connection
between
the
security
council
and
the
international
criminal
court
resides
in
the
capacity
of
the
former
to
refer
situations
or
to
suspend
investigations
in
accordance
with
articles
thirteen
and
sixteen
of
the
rome
statute
nevertheless
our
view
is
that
the
security
council
should
exercise
its
power
to
refer
situations
to
the
court
or
to
suspend
investigations
on
the
basis
of
consistent
parameters
showing
that
its
decisions
are
not
arbitrary
we're
also
convinced
of
the
need
that
the
security
council
in
addition
to
supporting
its
own
decisions
on
the
matter
and
follow-up
its
referrals
to
the
court
likewise
in
respect
of
its
referrals
the
security
council
must
pay
special
attention
to
refusals
to
cooperate
with
the
court
the
principle
of
complementarity
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
rome
statute
whereby
it
is
the
primary
obligation
of
national
courts
to
investigate
prosecute
and
punish
the
perpetrators
of
the
most
serious
crimes
of
international
scope
identified
in
the
rome
statute
in
that
regard
the
court
is
called
upon
intervene
in
cases
where
crimes
have
been
committed
within
national
jurisdictions
but
the
state
concerned
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
carry
out
the
respective
judicial
proceedings
finally
we
believe
that
cooperation
is
critical
to
the
work
of
the
court
for
that
reason
within
the
framework
of
the
high
level
meeting
of
the
general
assembly
on
the
rule
of
law
at
the
national
and
international
levels
that
took
place
in
september
twenty
fourth
my
country
chile
pledged
to
develop
legislation
aimed
at
cooperation
with
the
international
criminal
court
i
would
first
like
to
congratulate
you
mr
president
on
holding
a
debate
on
a
subject
that
is
so
central
to
the
united
nations
peace
mission
i
would
also
like
to
thank
the
secretary
general
for
his
introductory
remarks
and
to
pay
tribute
to
his
personal
commitment
to
strengthening
the
rule
of
law
in
the
service
of
the
values
of
peace
and
justice
finally
i
welcome
the
participation
of
the
president
of
the
international
criminal
court
icc
and
of
the
representative
of
the
office
of
the
icc
prosecutor
whom
we
thank
for
their
briefings
maintaining
and
strengthening
peace
achieving
sustainable
development
and
promoting
human
rights
are
at
the
heart
of
the
mission
of
the
united
nations
in
our
common
quest
for
a
multilateral
response
to
these
fundamental
and
complex
issues
we
remain
thoroughly
convinced
of
their
universality
and
indivisibility
nevertheless
faced
with
the
complexity
of
conflict
and
post
conflict
situations
it
is
difficult
if
not
delusional
to
attempt
to
offer
societies
affected
by
conflict
prefabricated
solutions
to
finding
peace
again
and
satisfying
their
desire
for
justice
strategies
and
measures
aimed
at
redressing
flagrant
violations
of
human
rights
and
international
humanitarian
law
must
take
into
account
the
specific
context
of
every
situation
in
order
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
crises
ensure
social
cohesion
and
promote
national
reconciliation
experience
has
shown
that
only
holistic
approaches
that
address
realities
and
are
owned
by
the
populations
concerned
can
ensure
sustainable
peace
peace
and
stability
are
sustainably
maintained
if
the
structural
causes
of
the
conflict
are
investigated
and
then
dealt
with
by
inter
alia
the
establishment
of
a
credible
independent
judicial
system
dedicated
to
the
primacy
of
the
law
in
that
context
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
and
other
international
legal
standards
must
represent
our
universal
point
of
reference
in
our
efforts
to
achieve
our
shared
goal
of
peace
and
justice
the
principles
of
sovereignty
equality
and
respect
for
the
national
unity
and
territorial
integrity
of
states
must
continue
to
guide
the
activities
of
the
united
nations
including
the
security
council
and
all
the
institutional
mechanisms
we
have
created
to
help
achieve
our
shared
goal
of
peace
and
justice
national
judicial
systems
should
continue
to
be
the
place
of
first
resort
for
implementing
the
principle
of
responsibility
primary
responsibility
for
prosecuting
the
perpetrators
of
serious
crimes
affecting
the
international
community
devolves
on
the
states
while
the
international
community
is
there
to
help
strengthen
their
national
capacities
to
bring
those
perpetrators
to
trial
nevertheless
when
national
systems
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
prosecute
such
international
criminals
that
is
where
the
international
criminal
court
comes
in
according
to
its
statute
it
is
the
court’s
task
to
help
the
international
community
to
fight
impunity
and
to
prosecute
those
responsible
for
genocide
war
crimes
against
humanity
and
crimes
of
aggression
based
on
the
principle
of
complementarity
we
cannot
forget
the
valuable
contribution
of
other
mechanisms
serving
our
shared
cause
of
peace
and
justice
particularly
the
international
tribunal
for
the
former
yugoslavia
the
international
criminal
tribunal
for
rwanda
and
the
special
court
for
sierra
leone
which
continue
to
play
a
significant
role
in
strengthening
peace
and
restoring
the
rule
of
law
nor
must
we
forget
the
contribution
of
the
so-called
hybrid
mechanisms
which
have
made
justice
accessible
to
the
peoples
concerned
rehabilitated
the
legitimacy
of
state
institutions
and
strengthened
national
legal
systems
finally
we
cannot
ignore
the
considerable
contribution
that
traditional
judicial
mechanisms
have
made
to
assuring
the
right
to
justice
truth
and
compensation
and
to
ensuring
that
crimes
committed
during
a
conflict
will
not
go
unpunished
in
that
context
we
commend
the
declaration
of
the
high
level
meeting
of
the
general
assembly
on
the
rule
of
law
at
the
national
and
international
levels
resolution
sixty
seven
slash
one
held
on
september
twenty
fourth
which
recognizes
that
justice
is
an
indispensable
factor
of
sustainable
peace
in
countries
in
conflict
or
post
conflict
situations
in
that
regard
we
are
pleased
that
transitional
justice
programmes
have
been
widely
integrated
into
united
nations
work
in
the
areas
of
the
rule
of
law
and
of
strategic
planning
post
conflict
situations
in
a
demonstration
of
our
commitment
to
the
international
community
in
combating
impunity
for
serious
crimes
article
twenty
three
of
morocco’s
new
constitution
adopted
last
year
states
that
genocide
crimes
against
humanity
war
crimes
and
all
serious
and
systematic
violations
of
human
rights
are
punishable
by
law
that
commitment
is
part
of
the
sweeping
reforms
my
country
has
recently
introduced
to
strengthen
the
rule
of
law
and
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
and
we
will
pursue
it
at
the
international
level
by
reinforcing
our
commitment
to
peacekeeping
activities
and
to
maintaining
security
under
the
aegis
of
the
united
nations
i
would
like
to
thank
you
sir
for
having
taken
the
initiative
of
organizing
this
debate
it
is
the
first
time
that
the
security
council
has
devoted
a
meeting
to
the
international
criminal
court

that
on
future
occasions
the

will
return
to
issue

is
of
great
relevance

colombia
is
a
state
party
to
the
rome
statute
as
such
it
has
repeatedly
expressed
its
clear
support
for
the
international
criminal
court
and
the
cause
of
international
criminal
justice
we
have
addressed
the
crimes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
our
national
legislation
adopted
specific
laws
and
cooperation
of
the
court
and
we're
among
the
first
countries
of
the
western
hemisphere
to
reach
agreement
with
the
court
and
the
execution
of
sentences
we
participated
actively
in
the
kampala
review
conference
of
the
rome
statute
that
currently
studying
the
amendments
adopted
there
with
a
view
to
incorporating
them
into
our
legislation
therefore
ascribed
the
greatest
importance
to
the
holding
of
this
debate
as
we
mark
the
first
ten
years
of
the
court's
work
noted
by
the
council
during
colombia's
presidency
in
july
i
will
focus
my
statement
and
current
issues
that
have
arisen
with
regard
to
the
interaction
between
the
security
council
and
the
international
criminal
court
first
of
all
we
believe
that
the
council
should
take
the
greatest
care
while
considering
referrals
new
situations
to
the
court
in
application
of
the
provisions
of
article
thirteen
of
the
rome
statute
we
must
recall
that
the
possibility
of
triggering
the
court's
jurisdiction
through
this
mechanism
was
enshrined
in
the
roman
statute
in
order
prevent
to
the
need
to
establish
new
ad-hoc
jurisdictional
bodies
for
the
rome
conference
participants
thought
was
to
provide
the
council
the
viable
alternative
to
which
to
turn
and
it
has
concluded
that
criminal
trials
of
certain
individuals
at
the
international
level
contribute
to
maintaining
international
peace
and
security
naturally
my
country
assigns
the
greatest
importance
to
the
principle
of
complementarity
which
is
the
very
backbone
of
the
international
criminal
justice
system
enshrined
in
the
rome
statute
in
this
regard
it
is
worth
stressing
that
complementarity
is
called
on
to
play
fundamental
role
in
all
cases
submitted
to
the
court
including
those
referred
by
the
council
it
was
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
libya
and
the
criminal
trials
resulting
from
resolution
nineteen
seventy
two
thousand
eleven
we
believe
that
one
of
the
factors
the
council
should
assess
when
considering
the
potential
referral
of
a
situation
to
the
icc
the
existence
of
legal
standards
and
institutions
in
the
country
concerned
based
on
which
it
would
be
possible
to
consider
referral
to
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
complimentarity
the
broad
powers
vested
in
the
council
under
article
thirteen
of
the
statute
limited
in
practice
because
of
other
provisions
of
the
statute
that
seek
to
put
into
practice
the
principle
of
complementarity
as
is
the
case
with
the
note
related
to
the
inadmissibility
of
cases
and
challenges
thereto
an
essential
component
of
this
mechanism
is
the
premise
that
relevant
decisions
of
the
council
will
be
rigorously
implemented
if
adopted
under
chapter
seven
and
after
the
council
had
determined
that
there
was
a
threat
to
international
peace
and
security
therefore
when
the
court
issues
an
arrest
warrant
and
they
are
not
carried
out
what
is
at
stake
is
the
credibility
of
the
council's
decisions
and
authority
it
may
be
worth
considering
alternative
formulations
for
inclusion
in
particular
resolution
referring
to
a
given
situation
to
the
icc
in
cases
of
darfur
in
libya
solution
adopted
consisted
of
imposing
two
series
of
obligations
on
the
one
hand
main
obligation
of
the
stakeholders
directly
involved
the
government
of
sudan
and
all
other
parties
to
the
conflict
in
darfur
first
place
and
libyan
authorities
in
the
second
is
to
cooperate
with
the
court
and
to
provide
the
offer
prosecutor
all
necessary
assistance
and
all
state
and
regional
and
international
organizations
are
called
on
to
cooperate
with
the
court
another
issue
related
to
council
referrals
that
has
arisen
recently
is
that
of
the
financing
of
trials
situation
that
has
arisen
on
both
occasions
when
the
council
has
resorted
to
this
mechanism
has
led
to
various
concerns
for
states
parties
to
the
statute
which
affect
the
application
of
the
relationship
agreement
between
the
icc
and
the
united
nations
we
believe
that
these
concerns
are
valid
and
should
be
considered
frankly
and
openly
by
both
security
council
and
the
general
assembly
as
well
as
by
the
assembly
of
states
parties
to
the
rome
statute
furthermore
the
alternative
mechanism
provided
for
in
article
sixteen
of
the
rome
statute
has
been
made
little
use
of
again
given
what
was
decided
at
plenipotentiary
diplomatic
conference
they
gave
rise
to
the
icc
chapter
7
of
the
charter
must
be
invoked
and
evaluation
by
the
council
the
potential
merit
of
requests
for
the
application
of
this
provision
must
involve
a
decision
to
apply
article
thirty
nine
of
charter
they
should
be
kept
in
mind
by
those
states
approaching
the
council
or
to
request
one
of
the
deferral
procedure
provided
for
under
article
sixteen
when
a
conflict
situation
threatens
international
peace
and
security
the
security
council
is
called
on
to
act
and
exercise
their
responsibilities
entrusted
to
it
by
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
situations
may
arise
in
which
accountability
has
become
a
necessary
measure
for
overcoming
crisis
and
restoring
international
peace
and
security
in
such
situations
council
can
use
the
instrument
of
international
criminal
justice
established
in
the
rome
treaty
and
already
provided
an
invaluable
not
only
in
pursuit
of
international
justice
and
the
fight
against
impunity
but
also
and
above
all
in
the
search
for
international
peace
and
security
